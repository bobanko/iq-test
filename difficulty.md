## how to - difficulty

1. get stats for 40 (base)
1. range difficulty by:

   - time spent
   - wrong/correct rate/not answered
     - global (users for q#123)
     - per user (between questions)

1. difficulty director (as in L4D):  
   `if` user answers correct:  
   increase difficulty+  
   `else` (wrong/skip/time):
   give easier Q (diff-)

1. limit by time?  
   calc iq based on answer's difficulty (range)
   precision/range? 130-140?  
   more answers - more precise  
   and higher possible IQ
